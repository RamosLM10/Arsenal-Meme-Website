<p>My name is Luis and I am an Arsenal fan! I made this site to showcase and highlight memes regarding Arsenal that I found on the web and also ones that I created. Please feel free to send me some quality content through Facebook or LinkedIn and I will upload it in this site as soon as I can. If you have not noticed by now but the colours of this website were inspired by Arsenal's third kit during the 2017/2018 season! Thank you for visiting this site! COYG!</p>
